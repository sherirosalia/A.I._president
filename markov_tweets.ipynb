Much of this information is already on file\",\" but I have long said that I may release....\",,,,\n\nThe Fake News Media,\" just like Election time 2016\",\" is bringing up my Taxes & all sorts of other nonsense with illegally obtained information & only bad intent. I paid many millions of dollars in taxes but was entitled\",\" like everyone else\",\" to depreciation & tax credits.....\",,,,\n\nThe Ballots being returned to States cannot be accurately counted.
